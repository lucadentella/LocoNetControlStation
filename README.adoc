**This is a Command station for model railroad**

It is based on ESP32 chip. Development is done with Arduino core for ESP32 on PlatformIO.

Planned features are:

* [x] Running locos on main track via DCC (broken now)
* [ ] OPS mode programming via DCC
* Loconet interface with routing from severa lsources:
** [x] Physical LocoNet bus (RX timings broken now)
** [x] LbServer (LocoNetOverTCP) over WiFi
** [x] USB-Serial interface (not tested)
* [x] WiFi control via WiThrottle protocol (EngineDriver or WiThrottle)
* [ ] Stored turnout roster
* [ ] DCC++ interface via USB-Serial or WiFi

The implementation is based on these libraries:

 *  https://github.com/positron96/LocoNet2[LocoNet2] - LocoNet bus support. The library is heavily modified to support several sources of loconet messages and to better use timers and RTOS tasks. 

 * https://github.com/positron96/DCCpp[DCCpp library] and https://github.com/DccPlusPlus/BaseStation[DCC++ project]. Used for DCC packet generation, heavily modified. 

 * https://github.com/positron96/withrottle[WifiThrottle] WiThrottle protocol. Mostly rewritten with the help of https://www.jmri.org/[JMRI] sources.

 * https://www.etlcpp.com/[Embedded Template Library] statically-sized containers are used.


## LocoNet routing

Since this project is an Ultimate Command Station, it must accepts Loconet messages from different sources: LocoNet bus itself, USB-Serial, LbServer. All messages must be transparently routed to between all connected buses. It means that:
 * There must be a routing mechanism for broadcasting messages from one source to others.
 * Existing frontend classes (e.g. Throttle) must be separated from hardware backend and conncted to other sources. When command station itself generates a message (e.g. a reply to throttle), it must be broadcasted to all sources.
 * Result of sending a message to the bus is only taken into account for real LocoNet bus; it is assumed that USB and WiFi always send packets successfully.

With this in mind, the LocoNet2 library was heavily redesigned and refactored.
The LocoNet class is now separated into hardware backend, a message parser, and a routing bus between them. 
Other sources of messages are connected to the bus and messages are delivered to the parser as well as send via other backends.
Frontend classes (Throttle, FastClock, SystemVariable etc) are connected to the message parser instead of hardware class and so can handle messages from all sources.
The parser has same interface (and same name) as original LocoNet class, so frontend classes are mostly unchanged.
