**This is a Command station for model railroad**

It is based on ESP32 chip. Development is done with Arduino core for ESP32 on PlatformIO.

Planned features are:

* [ ] Running locos on main track via DCC
* [ ] OPS mode programming via DCC
* [x] Loconet interface
* [x] WiFi control via WiThrottle protocol (EngineDriver or WiThrottle)
* [ ] Stored turnout roster
* [ ] PC Connection
** [ ] DCC++ interface via USB-UART **OR:**
** [ ] Loconet serial via USB-UART
** [ ] DCC++ interface via WiFi 
** [x] Loconet LBServer via WiFi


The implementation is based on these libraries:

 * https://github.com/positron96/LocoNet2[LocoNet2] - LocoNet bus support. The library is heavily modified to support several sources of loconet messages and to better use timers and RTOS tasks.

 * https://github.com/positron96/DCCpp[DCCpp library] and https://github.com/DccPlusPlus/BaseStation[DCC++ project]. Used for DCC packet generation, heavily modified.

 * https://github.com/positron96/withrottle[WifiThrottle] WiThrottle protocol. Mostly rewritten with the help of https://www.jmri.org/[JMRI] sources.

 * https://www.etlcpp.com/[Embedded Template Library]
